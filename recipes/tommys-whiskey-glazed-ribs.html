    <p>"Savor the Bold: Tommy's Whiskey-Glazed Ribs at The Garrison Tavern."</p>
    <p>Indulge in a dish that embodies the unyielding spirit of Tommy Shelby himself. Our succulent ribs, slow-cooked to perfection and basted in a rich whiskey glaze, are a testament to Birmingham's finest. Each bite is a journey through flavor, smokiness, and a touch of rebellion—a true Peaky Blinders delight.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

        <li>Prepare the Ribs:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Remove the membrane from the back of the ribs for tenderness.</li>
            <li>Season both sides of the ribs with salt, pepper, smoked paprika, and chili powder.</li>

        <li>Slow Cook the Ribs:</li>

            <li>Place the ribs on the grill, bone side down.</li>
            <li>Cover and cook for 2.5 to 3 hours, or until the meat is tender and begins to pull away from the bones.</li>
        </ul>

        <li>Prepare the Whiskey Glaze:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>In a saucepan, combine whiskey, brown sugar, tomato paste, apple cider vinegar, minced garlic, salt, and pepper.</li>
            <li>Simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the mixture thickens into a glaze (about 15-20 minutes).</li>
            <li>Remove from heat.</li>
        </ul>

        <li>Glaze the Ribs:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>During the last 30 minutes of grilling, brush the whiskey glaze generously over the ribs.</li>
            <li>Continue grilling, turning and basting every 10 minutes, until the ribs are glossy and the glaze is caramelized.</li>
        </ul>

        <li>Serve:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Remove the ribs from the grill and let them rest for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Cut between the bones and serve hot with extra whiskey glaze on the side.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
